## what i did today
i had a hard time with "jupyter notebook" and "venv"
because i didn't really understand about a word "kernel" of jupyternotebook.
if you wanna use venv-environment in jupyter notebook, you must change kernel to [venv-name] from Python3(defoult).
i i struggled bcaouse i hadn't know about that. fXXk.

but i gat new kowledge about jupyter-notebook. yeah
